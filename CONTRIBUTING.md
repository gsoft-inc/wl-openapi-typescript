## How Develop Locally

### Installation 

This project uses PNPM, therefore, you must [install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation):

To install the project, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Working with `@workleap/create-schemas`

To build it for development, from the `root` or `packages/create-schemas` folder, run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will build the project in development mode and link the binary locally (???). Once done, you will be able to run it from a terminal:

```bash
create-schemas
```
